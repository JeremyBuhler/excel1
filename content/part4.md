## Pivot tables

### Purpose
- introduce pivot tables for data analysis
- explore pivot table calculation options
- explore pivot table display options

### Why pivot tables?

Excel pivot tables make it easy to create new tables from your dataset without changing the original. They are an excellent way to explore your data and produce descriptive statistics.

Place your cursor in any cell in the table, then select *Insert -> Pivot table*.  Leave the default settings to create a pivot table in a new worksheet.

Each column in your original table is a building block you may use in the new "pivot" table you are creating (they're listed on the right side of the screen).  Drag the column headers into the *rows* or *columns* section below to establish the layout for your table.

### Pivot table settings
Most pivot table settings can be changed in one of two places:
- In *PivotTable Tools -> Analyze -> Options*
- In drop-down menus in the pivot table builder interface (see especially the *Value field settings*)

*Slicers* are visual filters that make it easier to switch between views of your data. To add a slicer go to *PivotTable Tools -> Analyze -> Insert Slicer*
