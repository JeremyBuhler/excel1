| `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `arrow` | *select* cells to next full/empty cell in chosen direction
| `CTRL` + `End` | move to bottom right corner of sheet
| `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `End` | *select* cells from current position to bottom right corner of sheet
| `CTRL` + `Home` | move to bottom right corner of sheet
| `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `End` | *select* cells from current position to bottom right corner of sheet

Selected menu shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action
| --- | --- 
| `CTRL` + `F` | open *find/replace* dialog box
| `CTRL` + `C` | copy cell contents
| `CTRL` + `ALT` + `V` | open *paste special* dialog box (e.g. to paste values instead of forumlas)

###Use a working copy

Exported data often includes content that needs to be reformatted or is not required for the analysis. Before deleting anything, copy all your data into a new worksheet and save the file in .xlsx format. Use the working copy for any analysis but preserve the original for reference.
