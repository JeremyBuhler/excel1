 # Analyzing survey data in Excel
 
 The goal of this lesson is to introduce students to several data manipulation and analysis features in Excel. Starting with a .csv of survey results exported from Qualtrics, participants will format the data for analysis, create derived variables, and generate descriptive statistics using formulas and pivot tables.
 
 Download <a href="sample_data.csv" download="download">sample_data.csv</a> and save it somewhere accessible.
